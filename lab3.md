**Researching Grep**
---
For this lab, I will be researching the command `grep`. `grep` is able to search for a pattern within a file and displays it. I will also be exploring a few different command line options for `grep`

**Command-line Options for Grep**
---
**1. grep -r**
`grep -r` is used to recursively search a particular string in all the files in the current directory. It is useful because it allows you to search for a pattern in all files at once instead of searching through each file individually, which can save a lot of time.

For example, here I typed in `grep -r "truth"`. I expect it to search for the word "government" recursively in the current directory.



Another example of `grep -r' working is when I typed in `grep -r "power"`. It should search for the word "power" recursively in the current directoy.

**2. grep -c**
`grep -c` is used to count the number of times a specific pattern appears in a file.


**3. grep-v**
`grep -v` is used to search for lines that do not contain the pattern in the single file.
